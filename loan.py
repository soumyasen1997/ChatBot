This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting interest rates.

At the end of the balance transfer process, you will owe the new lender whatever payments plus applicable interest that is left on your current loan.

data_entry(1,"Why do my initial EMIs have little impact on the principal amount due","A major portion of your initial EMIs are actually used to pay off the interest dues on your home loan. This process is termed as 'front loading', hence only a small portion of the principal is paid off initially.

data_entry(1,"How is having higher credit score beneficial","A higher credit score indicates that you have a good track record with respect to loans that you have borrowed in the past. Therefore if you credit score is high (more than 750 in case of CIBIL TransUnion), your chances of being granted a loan are much higher than if you have a lower score. Additionally, you may be able to negotiate benefits such as a lower interest rate, higher loan amount, waiver of processing charges, etc. by leveraging your high credit score.")
data_entry(1,"What do the terms settlement, default and closed mean? Does it affect my credit score","If you get a copy of your credit report, you might come across the terms – settlement, default or closed with respect to your old or current loans and credit cards. The term “settlement” means that you and the lender have come to an agreement according to which, you have paid a portion of your dues and the lender would no longer pursue you for the balance amount. Up to 40% of your total dues may be waived off by the lender as part of the settlement process however it should be used as a last resort when you are having problems with paying off your dues. If any of your borrowings is marked as a “default”, it means that you have not paid your dues with respect to that loan or credit card. Additionally, you and the lender were unable to come to an agreement regarding the outstanding dues. A “closed” tag is only provided to your prior loans or credit cards and it indicates that these loans/credit cards have been paid off in full. If the terms settled and/or default show up on your credit report, it reflects poorly on your credit history and adversely impact your credit score. Due to your low credit score you would be considered as a risky borrower by prospective lenders. The tem “closed” means that you have successfully completed all due payments on a loan or credit card, this is one of the key factors that lead to a robust credit score and you will be considered as a stable borrower by prospective lenders.")
